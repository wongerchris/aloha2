##Aloha Website Overview

This is a static website with a mobile first approach. Media queries were added for phone, tablet and desktop.  

Additional implementations included turning css into sass and using Gulp to compile, minify and add vendor prefixâ€™s for the project.  

####Technical Goals
The goal of the project was to write semantically correct html, write well organized and efficient css, and successfully implement multiple jQuery requirements. 

####Visual Goals
We were given design comps with typography, color, and structural requirents.  The goal was to style the project as close as possible to the design requirments.
